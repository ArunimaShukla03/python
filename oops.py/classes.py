#OOPs is Object Oriented Programming

class Person ():
  pass

# In order to avoid the IDE from stating that there is nothing inside the class, we use "pass" keyword.

# Now to create an object of class "Person"

person1 = Person()

# Now to assign some attributes to class

person1.age = 24
person1.name = "Arunima"
person1.favourite_color = "none"

print(person1.age)
print(person1.name)
